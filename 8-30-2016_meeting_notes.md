# Meeting Notes - 8/30/2016 - CDC@UI

## What is the club
Learning about security, hacking, and everything in-between, with the goal of improving the security of ourselves and those around us.

## Who can attend
Students interested in learning about Security and hacking, regardless of educational background. The security field is about learning "on the fly" and Googling everything.

# Meeting Schedule: Every Tuesday 7PM @ RADICL (JEB 006)
	1. This meeting! (8/30)
	2. What is security
		○ Definitions: Malware, Vulnerabilities/Exploits, "VMs", Networks, "Cyber", APTs, etc.
		○ Who are hackers? (The original hackers, the bad kind, motivations and "hats")
		○ How does teh Internets work?
		○ Malwarez
		○ Professions: Penetration testing/red teaming (get paid lots of cash dollars to hack)
		○ Well-known hacks (DNC hack, OPM records)
		○ [Jargon](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/)
	3. General Security: Making yourself, family, and friends safe and secure
		a. Common threats and dangers on the big bad internet
		b. The various attacks
		c. "Hardening" systems (Like Mom's Windows 7 computer, or Grandpa's MacBook)
		d. WiFi dangers
		e. Tor, VPNs, proxies, reducing your Internet "footprint"
		f. Internet Background Radiation (Yes, it's an actual thing that's actually studied)
	4. Hardware hacking!
		a. If you have interesting hardware, bring it!
		b. If you have tools (or interesting tools!), bring them
		c. If you don't, come and learn! 
	5. Password cracking?
	6. TBD

# Meeting Notes
	• If you have a laptop, bring it. This isn't a class (don't listen to Anton), I'm not a lecturer, and you should totally google things as we talk about them, mess around with stuff, show people stuff, etc.
	• There are some cool competitions that we could do. If you're interested in these, do some research, email us, and we'll help you put together a team (or teams!). There is also club funding available through ASUI that can help support things such as travel, lodging, and fees. Some examples of cool competitions:
		○ CSAW
		○ NICCDC
		○ PRCCDC
		○ Capture-the-flag ("CTFs") competitions (Google it, there are hundreds)
		○ Hackathons (Not necessarily security, but really awesome regardless)
	• If you don't have a cluster at home, don't fear, RADICL is here! The lab we meet in has a cluster we can use to do stuff like full network attack/defend exercises (CTF, King of the Hill, etc), password cracking, play around with some cool OS you found, etc. The admins need some lead time to get stuff loaded, so if you want to do stuff on it just get in touch with the admins a few days before.
	• If you really like learning about security, there are courses offered by the University! CS 336 is the introduction course (offered in the Fall), as well as the "Cyber Defense" course to prepare for the PRCCDC competition (offered both semesters). Look in the class schedule while planning for spring. Also, the SFS program will pay for up to 3 years of your education at any level, along with a stipend, to specialize in security. Email Daniel Conte de Leon (dcontedeleon@uidaho.edu) for more information about the courses or the program.
	• Code from the demo is on GitHub (https://github.com/CDC-UI/cdc-intro)  If you want to add code it it or make a new project, email me, and I'll add you to the organization. 

# Law and Ethics
(While I'm usually freewheeling and sarcastic, let me put on my serious hat for this.)
(I'm not a lawyer, this shouldn't constitute legal advice. Still, take it seriously)
	• Accessing any system you do not have authorization to access is ILLEGAL. The laws regarding this can be quite strict, judges are not kind folks, and you could go to jail for a long time for hacking your friend's laptop as a joke.
	• We are learning skills that could potentially be used to do bad things™. Use your best judgement when learning and playing around with these skills. Use Virtual Machines to isolate yourself from the UI network, be careful read licence agreements before reverse engineering ("reversing") software, and above all: think before you click
	• Rule of thumb: If you are profiting, using with malicious intent, or violating a law it is a bad thing™. Don't do it. Learn to become a cyber defender and protect those you love, not a basement script kiddie who's despised by all.
	• Act ethically. Again, use your best judgement. If it feels wrong to you, err on the side of caution. Do more research, bring it up at a meeting, ask us or another member.
Scared? Good. This stuff is incredibly awesome, but like explosives, incredibly dangerous if used without proper safety or for the wrong reasons. 

# Resources
	• Google.com (This is not a joke. Ask anyone in security, they will swear by it)
	• Wikipedia.org (Actually very useful for learning about new technologies and terminology)
	• YouTube: tons of great, interesting videos on anything and everything security. (Security people make videos, upload to YouTube, then link to the video from their blog. So, go to the source!)
	• Twitter: the social media of choice for many security folks. You'll learn a lot by following people in the field.
	• GitHub: source code and binaries for everything from LIVE Malware to Tools and OS distributions (Linux is on here!)
	• CodeAcademy: Many useful lessons on topics useful for security.

# Tools and Technology (All free of charge)
	• VirtualBox (virtualbox.org): virtual machine host that runs on Windows, OSX, and Linux. Useful for trying out a new operating system (OS), hacking tools (just remove the network interface first!!), coding in new languages that don't work on your system, and everything in between.
	• Kali Linux (kali.org): The OS for security and hacking. Includes tools for everything from network recon and wireless analysis to reverse engineering and social engineering included "out of the box". There are even pre-built VirtualBox images you can download, so you don't have to bother with installing it in a new VM.
	• IdaPro: Binary analysis and decompilation. Very useful for reverse engineering, including malware analysis. 
	• Python (python.org): Easy-to-learn interpreted programming language that is by far the most widely used language in security and hacking. CodeAcademy (codeacademy.org) has a great series that will teach you the basics with a few hours of simple hands-on tutorials.

# Ideas list (for future meetings)
If you have ideas: email us, bring it up at a meeting, or BRING IT to a meeting.
	• Capture the Flags
	• PRCCDC competition (there's a course for this that you don't have to be in)
	• Reverse engineering 
	• Malware analysis
	• Car hacking 
	• Wireless network sniffing
	• Network recon
	• Password cracking (John the Ripper)

	• OverTheWire.org (Bandit, etc)
	• Cross-site scripting
	• "URL changing"
	• Public information gathering 
	• ("Google Hacking")
	• Lockpicking (don't pick your roommates lock)

Apologies for the long email. I'll post these (and this) on the club GitHub from now on, and just put a short summary and link in the email.  (https://github.com/CDC-UI)

Thanks for coming, and I hope to see you all next Tuesday.
Oh, and bring friends!
